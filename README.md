### 💫 About Me
I'm an 18-year-old student who enjoys exploring the world of programming.  
I love *thinking, designing, and building new projects* that continuously improve my skills.  
What excites me the most is making different parts of code work together —  
like connecting the *frontend* and *backend* into one seamless system.  

Right now, I’m focusing on *creating professional, visually beautiful front-end designs*  
and pushing myself until I can turn everything I imagine into real, working projects 💻💭
